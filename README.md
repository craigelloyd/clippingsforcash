# Clippings for Cash

I made this simple web page as a joke for the guide creation team at iFixit, who need to keep their hands well-manicured for photos. Part of that requires keeping our nails clean and clipping them when they get too long, which the team sometimes does at work.

## How It Works

1. Type in your hourly pay rate in the "Hourly Pay" box. Only include the number and not the dollar sign.
2. In the "Times per Week" box, enter in the average number of times per week that you clip your fingernails.
3. Click "Calculate".

Based on an average of three minutes per clipping session, your yearly Clippings Cash will display at the bottom of the window.
